## Details

* Enhancement - Previous releases and introducing semver: [#10](https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud-sdk/issues/10)

   We created the ownCloud SDK to provide developers with a well documented and easy-to-use
   solution for interaction with ownCloud backends from their JavaScript applications.

   While in the previous years, each successful CI run would publish a new version of the SDK, we
   have now switched to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
