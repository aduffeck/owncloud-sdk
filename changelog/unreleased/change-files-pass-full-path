Change: Pass full file or directory path to methods of Files class

Since incompatibility with spaces, we changed the way how the methods of the class
Files(filesManagement.js) need to be called.
Now it is mandatory to pass the full webDav(v2) path of a file or directory.

For example, before this change the path was: 'myfile.txt', with this change it is: 'files/admin/myfile.txt'
