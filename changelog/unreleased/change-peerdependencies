Change: Use peerDependencies instead of dependencies

In the past, we used dependencies in package.json which lead to a big bundle size and increased the possibility 
that the same package with 2 different versions is part of the final bundle of the consuming application.

From now on, dependencies that are required to use the SDK are added to the peerDependencies section in package.json. 
The consuming application then has to add the dependency on its own and can decide which minor or bugfix version to use.
