Enhancement: Previous releases and introducing semver

We created the ownCloud SDK to provide developers with a well documented and easy-to-use solution 
for interaction with ownCloud backends from their JavaScript applications.

While in the previous years, each successful CI run would publish a new version 
of the SDK, we have now switched to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
